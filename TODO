# TODO FOR 
1. Add logging to your logs folder
So every reminder trigger gets written to:data/logs/reminders.log
2. Add MQTT or TTS notifications
So Sonny can actually speak reminders or push them to your devices.
3. Add a second scheduler for routines
Morning routines, evening shutdown, medication reminders, etc.
4. Add a calendar sync service
Pull events from Google/Outlook → write to .
